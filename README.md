Is that EzKahoot ??? @SotirisTzanakis

Hello there homo homo sapiens! How are you doing? This is another great project by me.

This is a Kahoot solver. It works by copying the Kahoot title, opening a new tab, and pasting it into the Kahoot search. But you have to do some of the work (it's not that much). You just have to click the file 
and then click the "show answers button" yeah.

The first step is to open visual studio download from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Yes yes I learned how to make it blue text wow.
Then when the kahoot title shows QUICK click start (the arrow thingy)
After the program ends, just click the kahoot and then show answers.
KABOOM. (we do not talk about my kahoot choice)
