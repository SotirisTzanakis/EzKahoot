Is that EzKahoot ??? 

Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my project "EzKahoot".

It is very simle just copying the title and searching it.
To run it you will need Microsoft Visual Studio Code which you can download from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
You will also need python 3.11 or later and pip install these: pyperclip, webbrowser, pyautogui and time.
Note that you dont need a nasa pc or fiber internet just a stable connection and a somewhat ok PC.
